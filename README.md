  # Slimehack

  ## Description

  Slimehack emerged as both an experiment and a challenge. My goal was to explore the potential of building a project using a highly transformative library, pushing the boundaries of my understanding of object-oriented programming. The entire development process proved to be enjoyable, and engaging with the open-source community at itch.io proved to be a rewarding experience, allowing me to learn a great deal.
